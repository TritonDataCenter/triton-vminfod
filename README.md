# triton-vminfod

Triton VM information daemon that runs on a Triton compute node.

This branch is deliberately empty. The vminfod code for SmartOS lives in the
[smartos-live](https://github.com/joyent/smartos-live/tree/master/src/vm/node_modules/vminfod)
repository. The Linux vminfod code resides in this repository in the
[linuxcn](https://github.com/joyent/triton-vminfod/tree/linuxcn) branch.
